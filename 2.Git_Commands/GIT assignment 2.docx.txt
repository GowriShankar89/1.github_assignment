git status will give status of git like any file has been modified or added,deleted below is example

On branch main
nothing to commit, working tree clean

On branch main
nothing to commit, working tree clean

2. How to delete a Git local branch?
git branch -D branchname

git branch -D local 

3. How can I add a project to Git that already exists?
Open the Terminal access to that folder 
git init
git add .
git commit -m "my commit"
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:username/repo.git
git push origin master

4. What exactly is a Git fork? What are the distinctions between a fork, a branch, and a clone? 
Forking is a concept while cloning is a process. Forking is just containing a separate copy of the repository and there is no command involved. 
Cloning is done through the command 'git clone' and it is a process of receiving all the code files to the local machine.
A repository code branch, like a branch of a tree, remains part of the original repository. The code that is branched (main trunk) and the branch know and rely on each other. 
Like a tree trunk's branch, a code branch knows about the trunk (original code base) it originated from.

5. What is the difference between HEAD, working tree, and index in GIT? 
working tree is what is actually in the files that you are currently working on.

HEAD is a pointer to the branch or commit that you last checked out, and which will be the parent of a new commit if you make it. For instance, if you're on the master branch, then HEAD will point to master, and when you commit, that new commit will be a descendent of the revision that master pointed to, and master will be updated to point to the new commit.

The index is a staging area where the new commit is prepared. Essentially, the contents of the index are what will go into the new commit (though if you do git commit -a, this will automatically add all changes to files that Git knows about to the index before committing, so it will commit the current contents of your working tree). git add will add or update files from the working tree into your index.

6. Which GIT command is used to change branches?


7. What is the difference between GitHub and Git?
Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history. GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories. I

8. What are some of the advantages of using the Variation Control System? Which programming language is used in Git?
Version control systems are a category of software tools that helps in recording changes made to files by keeping a track of modifications done to the code. 
C, Shell, Perl, Tcl

9. List out some Git repository features.
