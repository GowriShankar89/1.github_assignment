1. What is a git stash list?

Ans :-  git-stash - Stash the changes in a dirty working directory away

List the stash entries that you currently have. Each stash entry is listed with its name (e.g.  stash@{0} is the latest entry, stash@{1} is the one before, etc.), the name of the branch that was current when the entry was
           made, and a short description of the commit the entry was based on.

               stash@{0}: WIP on submit: 6ebd0e2... Update git-stash documentation
               stash@{1}: On master: 9cc0589... Add git-stash


2. How do you get a list of all the files that have been updated in a given commit?

Ans :-  git status will give list of all the files that have been updated in a given commit

DataScientist:/run/media/gowrishankarphd/Gowri Shankar/3.Learning/11.One neuron assignment/1.github_assignment/1.Git_repository->git status
On branch main
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   GIT assignment 1.docx.txt

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")



3. What is a Git merge conflict?

Git Merge conflict example.suppose if i have two branch say 1.Main 2.DEV and 1.Main has 1 file eg 1.txt and 2.Dev has 1 file 1.txt and i already merged .suppoese if i change 3 line in 1.txt in Dev branch and try will
have git merge conflict either i need to manually change dev branch 1.txt line 3.  

4. How do you distinguish between git fetch and git pull? How do you differentiate between Git Merge and Git Rebase?

git fetch is the command that tells your local git to retrieve the latest meta-data info from the original (yet doesn’t do any file transferring. It’s more like just checking to see if there are any changes available).

git pull on the other hand does that AND brings (copy) those changes from the remote repository.

Git rebase and merge both integrate changes from one branch into another. Where they differ is how it's done. Git rebase moves a feature branch into a master. Git merge adds a new commit, preserving the history.

5. What command uploads any GitHub repository to your computer using the git command?

git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
git push -u origin master

6. How do you write a commit message using the command? How do you push code in GitHub?

git commit -m "message"
git add.
git commit -m 'messgase"
git push origin main

7. How do you make a Git repository?
Create a directory to contain the project.
Go into the new directory.
Type git init.
Write some code.
Type git add to add the files (see the typical use page).
Type git commit.
The first file to create (and add and commit) is probably a ReadMe file, either as plain text or with Markdown, describing the project.

Markdown allows you to add a bit of text markup, like hyperlinks, bold/italics, or to indicate code with a monospace font. Markdown is easily converted to html for viewing in a web browser, and GitHub will do this for you automatically.

8. What is Git, and how does it work?

Git is a version control keep tracks on all changes in git so it is useful for developers .
